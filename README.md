#### Regional Moisture Retention vs Soil Types Graph
Determining soil type is important to selecting crops that can be grown on that soil. Certain plants like cotton require
clayey soil with high water retention capacity while carrots, radishes, and beets prefer sandy soil. The dataset provides
soil types in different regions in Melbourne. Plotting the soil distribution graph as a map provides additional details such
as the water resources available.
This visual representation highlights the importance of IoT in mapping soil types. The detailed mapping can help identify
suitable crops and maximize production. Including a larger ecosystem of such sensors, a single large farmland can be used
to maximize yield/profit.

#### Moisture Retention for Different Soil Types
The line graph shows the moisture retention capacity percentage over time for different soil types. It is clear that
moisture retention follows clay > loam > sand order
This graph highlights how IoT sensors provide real-time data on soil moisture, which is essential for AI to make informed
irrigation decisions. By understanding moisture retention differences, smart systems can adjust water distribution,
enhancing water use efficiency and crop health.

#### Soil Temperature Variations
The line graph tracks soil temperature variations over time at different depths
Monitoring soil temperature at various depths using IoT sensors aids in optimizing irrigation schedules and crop
management. By integrating this data with AI, farmers can anticipate and mitigate stress conditions like frost or heat,
improving overall crop resilience and yield.

##### Soil Water Level
The line graph shows the groundwater level over time at different depths
Real-time monitoring of soil water levels at various depths allows for precise irrigation control. This data supports the
articleâ€™s point on how cloud computing and IoT facilitate real-time analysis and decision-making, leading to efficient
water use and reduced manual intervention.
